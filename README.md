### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- JSX
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- React

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```jsx
import headerImg from "./img/illustration-hero.svg"
import musicIcon from "./img/icon-music.svg"

<img src={headerImg} alt="header illustration" />
<img src={musicIcon} alt="music icon" />
```


### Continued development

I need to practice more imports and exports for React; specially the import/export of resources such as images.
